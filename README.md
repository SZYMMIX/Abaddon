# Abaddon

A raw implementation of a **pseudo-3D raycasting engine** written from scratch in Python using **Pygame**.

This project aims to recreate the classic rendering technique popularized by *Wolfenstein 3D*. It generates a 3D perspective from a 2D grid map using raycasting mathematics, without relying on modern 3D hardware acceleration.

### ⚠️ Project Status: Work in Progress
This project is currently in the **early stages of development**. I am building this to understand the underlying math behind retro FPS games.

### Requirements:
*   Python 3.x
*   Pygame

### How to Run:
```bash
pip install pygame
python main.py
